NAME
    Animation.Cube -- Rotating Cube Animation Effect

SYNOPSIS
    2-Images-Rotation-Mode:

        var cube = new Animation.Cube( img_id, "next.jpg" );
        cube.rotate();

    N-Images-Loop-Mode:

        var list = [
            "first.jpg",
            "second.jpg",
            "third.jpg",
            "forth.jpg"
        ];
        var cube = new Animation.Cube( img_id, list );
        cube.rotate();

DESCRIPTION
    This library provides a rotating cube animation effect.

METHODS
  cube = new Animation.Cube( id_or_elem, "next.jpg" );
    This constructor method returns a new Animation.Cube object. First
    argument is a <img> element or its id. 2-Images-Rotation-Mode is used
    when second argument is a image's URL.

  cube = new Animation.Cube( id_or_elem, ["1st.jpg","2nd.jpg",...] );
    N-Images-Loop-Mode is used when second argument is a array for URLs.
    Number of images is not limited. I think four images is best for
    intuitive cube's shape.

  cube.rotate();
    This method starts a animation effect.

  cube.finish();
    This method forces to stop a animation effect if it's running.

  PROPERTIES
    Following properties are available:

        cube.onComplete = function (cur) { ... };
        cube.onInterval = function (cur) { ... };
        cube.background = "#000000";
        cube.waitSeconds = 1.000;
        cube.rotateSeconds = 0.500;
        cube.minResolution =  2;
        cube.maxResolution = 32;
        cube.cursor = 0;
        cube.clockWise = true;
